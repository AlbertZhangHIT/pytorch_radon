# Torch Radon 
PyTorch implementation of Radon transform. Right now only 2-dimentional case on CPU is supported. Contributions to higher dimentional cases and GPU cases are welcome.

# Motivation
The motivation of this project is the disagreement of the inverse radon transform in scikit-image implementation with MATLAB (refer to issue [#3742](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/3742)).

# Requirements
The requirements for the conda environment in which I have tested this code are started in `requirements.txt`. The main dependencies are

    1. python >= 3.6
    2. pytorch >= 1.0

# Usage


# Liscence
